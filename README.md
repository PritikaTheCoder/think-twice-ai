# Think Twice AI

**Think Twice AI** is a reflection-based decision intelligence web application designed to help users pause, reflect, and make better decisions before acting emotionally.

Instead of telling users what to do, the platform simulates future consequences and emotional impact — encouraging thoughtful, responsible decision-making.

This project was built as a **new and original prototype** for **United Hacks**.

## Inspiration

Many impulsive decisions are made in moments of stress, anger, or urgency.  
Think Twice AI was created to introduce a meaningful pause — helping users reflect on how their decisions may feel days later.

---

## What It Does

- Allows users to log decisions they are about to make
- Captures emotional state and urgency
- Simulates:
  - “Future You” responses
  - Regret probability
  - Emotional temperature
- Displays insights and decision history
- Encourages mindful action rather than impulsive behavior

---

## Key Features

- One-page modern web application
- Clean, calming, human-centered UI
- Reflection-based AI simulation (no command-style outputs)
- Dashboard with insights and history
- Modal-based interaction for smooth UX
- Designed for scalability and future AI integration

---

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React + TypeScript(prototype)
- Styling: Modern UI principles (glassmorphism, soft dark mode)
- Architecture: Single-page application
- Platform: Web

> Note: This is a frontend prototype. Backend, database, and AI inference layers are planned for future iterations.

---

## Live Demo

A live deployment is planned for a future iteration.
For this submission, a complete walkthrough of the application and interaction flow is provided in the demo video.

---

## Demo Video

A 2–5 minute demo video walkthrough is included in the hackathon submission, showcasing:
- Landing and authentication
- Dashboard and insights
- Decision reflection flow
- “Future You” simulation

---

## Future Improvements

- Backend authentication and user accounts
- Persistent database storage
- Personalized reflection patterns
- AI-powered reasoning engine
- Analytics and long-term emotional insights

---

## Ethical Considerations

Think Twice AI is designed to promote thoughtful decision-making without replacing human judgment.  
The system encourages reflection, not dependency.
